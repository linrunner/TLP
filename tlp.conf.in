# Settings are read in the following order:
#
# 1. Intrinsic defaults
# 2. /etc/tlp.d/*.conf - Drop-in customization snippets
# 3. /etc/tlp.conf     - User configuration (this file)
#
# Power Profiles: a part of TLP's parameters is divided into two or three
# groups:
# - performance: parameters ending in _AC are used when AC power is
#   connected or when the command 'tlp performance' is run.
# - balanced: parameters ending in _BAT are used when operating
#   on battery power or when the command 'tlp balanced' is run.
# - power-saver: parameters ending in _SAV are used when the command
#   'tlp power-saver' is run. If there is no _SAV parameter available
#   for a feature, the _BAT parameter will be used instead.
# - Any remaining parameters not divided apply to all power profiles.
#
# Please note:
# - If parameters are specified more than once, the last occurrence takes
#   precedence. This also means that any parameters defined here will take
#   precedence over any drop-ins.
# - You can however, append values to a parameter already defined as intrinsic
#   default or in a previously read file: use PARAMETER+="add values".
# - Important: all parameters are disabled here. Remove the leading '#' if you
#   want to enable a feature without a default or if you want to set a value
#   other than the default.
# - Parameters must always be specified for all power profiles, i.e. in the
#   AC, BAT and SAV category (where applicable). If you omit one of them,
#   the missing profile will receive its value from another profile, since
#   a change will only occur if different values are defined.
# - To completely disable a parameter, use PARAMETER="".
# Legend for defaults:
# - Default *: intrinsic default that is effective when the parameter is
#   missing or the line has a leading #'.
# - Default <none>: do nothing or use kernel/hardware defaults.
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# tlp - Parameters for power saving

# Set to 0 to disable, 1 to enable TLP.
# Default: 1

#TLP_ENABLE=1

# Set to 1 to deactivate all intrinsic defaults of TLP. This means that
# TLP only applies settings that have been explicitly activated i.e.
# parameters without a leading '#'.
# Notes:
# - Helpful if one wants to use only selected features of TLP
# - After activation, use tlp-stat -c to display your effective configuration

#TLP_DISABLE_DEFAULTS=1

# Control how warnings about invalid settings are issued:
#   0=disabled
#   1=background tasks (boot, resume, change of power source) report to syslog
#   2=shell commands report to the terminal (stderr)
#   3=combination of 1 and 2
# Default: 3

#TLP_WARN_LEVEL=3

# Colorize error, warning, notice and success messages. Colors are specified
# with ANSI codes:
#   1=bold black, 90=grey, 91=red, 92=green, 93=yellow, 94=blue, 95=magenta,
#   96=cyan, 97=white.
# Other colors are possible, refer to:
#   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#3-bit_and_4-bit
# Colors must be specified in the order
#   "<error> <warning> <notice> <success>".
# By default, errors are shown in red, warnings in yellow, notices in bold
# and success in green.
# Default: "91 93 1 92"

#TLP_MSG_COLORS="91 93 1 92"

# Control automatic switching of the power profile when connecting or removing
# the charger, when booting the system or when executing 'tlp start':
#   0=disabled - never switch, use TLP_DEFAULT_MODE if configured
#   1=auto  - always switch, select performance on AC and
#             balanced on battery power.
#   2=smart - do not switch if the following profiles were active previously:
#             power-saver or balanced on AC resp.
#             power-saver or performance on battery power.
# Note: the same applies if the charger was connected/removed during suspend.
# Default: 2

#TLP_AUTO_SWITCH=2

# Power profile to use when automatic switching is disabled
# (TLP_AUTO_SWITCH=0), profile is locked (TLP_PERSISTENT_DEFAULT=1)

# Battery Care -- Charge thresholds
# Charging starts when the charger is connected and the charge level
# is below the start threshold. Charging stops when the charge level
# is above the stop threshold.
# Required hardware: Lenovo ThinkPads and other laptop brands are driven
#   via specific plugins:
# - Use the tlp-stat -b command to see if a plugin for your hardware is
#   active and to look up vendor-specific threshold values. Some
#   laptops support only 1 (on)/0 (off) instead of a percentage level.
# - If your hardware supports a start *and* a stop threshold, you must
#   specify both, otherwise TLP will refuse to apply the single threshold.
# - If your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start
#   value to 0.
# - The names of the batteries shown by tlp-stat -b don't have to match
#   the _BAT0 or _BAT1 parameter qualifiers. Please refer to [2]
#   to see which qualifier applies to which battery.
# For further explanation and all vendor specific details refer to
