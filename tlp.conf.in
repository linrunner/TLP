# Settings are read in the following order:
#
# 1. Intrinsic defaults
# 2. /etc/tlp.d/*.conf - Drop-in customization snippets
# 3. /etc/tlp.conf     - User configuration (this file)
#
# Notes:
# - In case of identical parameters, the last occurence has precedence
# - This also means, parameters enabled here will override anything else
# - However you may append values to a parameter already defined as intrinsic
#   default or in a previously read file: use PARAMETER+="add values"
# - IMPORTANT: all parameters here are disabled; remove the leading '#' if you
#   like to enable a feature without default or have a value different from the
#   default
# - Default *: intrinsic default that is effective when the parameter is missing
#   or disabled by a leading '#'; use PARAM="" to disable an intrinsic default
# - Default <none>: do nothing or use kernel/hardware defaults
# - IMPORTANT: parameters must always be specified pairwise i.e. for
#   both AC and BAT. Omitting one of the two makes the set value effective for
#   both power sources, since a change only occurs when different values are
#   defined.

# Battery Care -- Charge thresholds
# Charging starts when the charger is connected and the charge level
# is below the start threshold. Charging stops when the charge level
# is above the stop threshold.
# Required hardware: Lenovo ThinkPads and select other laptop brands
# are driven via specific plugins
# - Active plugin and support status are shown by tlp-stat -b
# - Vendor specific threshold levels are shown by tlp-stat -b, some
#   laptops support only 1 (on)/ 0 (off) instead of a percentage level
# - When your hardware supports a start *and* a stop threshold, you must
#   specify both, otherwise TLP will refuse to apply the single threshold
# - When your hardware supports only a stop threshold, set the start
#   value to 0
# - Older ThinkPads may require an external kernel module, refer to the
#   output of tlp-stat -b
# For further explanation and vendor specific details refer to
