This build of TLP comes with tlp-gtk aka ThinkVantage Dashboard, a graphical
interface for tlp-stat.

tlp-gtk can be extended via plugins which are pythonic classes.

```python
class MyPlugin():
    def __init__(self):
        # Perform basic initialization
        self.autoupdate = False # Reloads data via getListboxRows every 3 seconds

    def getHeader(self):
        # Return a title as shown in the sidebar
        return 'My Plugin'

    def shouldDisplay(self):
        # Perform checks whether this plugin is available on this ThinkPad
        return True

    def getListboxRows(self):
        # Return a list of GtkWidgets for the main area
        rows = []
        # Displays the title ('Nothing') on the left, and the content of the
        # file ('/dev/null') on the right
        rows.append(addToListbox('Nothing', '/dev/null'))

        # Adds a the title on the left, and a progressbar with subtitle
        # on the right
        rows.append(addPercentageToListbox('How full is the glass?',
                50.0,
                "volume of liquid"
        ))

        # Custom row with a GtkBox
        box = Gtk.Box()
        box.add(Gtk.Label("Hello"))
        box.add(Gtk.Label("World"))
        rows.append(box)

        return rows

# Add an instance of the plugin for auto-discovery with priority 99
PLUGINS.append((99, MyPlugin()))
```

Linking to the ThinkVantage button:
```bash
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ name 'ThinkVantage'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ binding 'Launch1'
gsettings set org.gnome.settings-daemon.plugins.media-keys.custom-keybinding:/org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/media-keys/custom-keybindings/custom0/ command "python3 /path/to/tlp-gtk.py"
```

TLP README - 05.01.2015

TLP brings you the benefits of advanced power management for Linux without the need
to understand every technical detail. TLP comes with a default configuration already
optimized for battery life, so you may just install and forget it. Nevertheless TLP
is highly customizable to fulfil your specific requirements.

TLP is a pure command line tool with automated background tasks. It does not contain a GUI.

Separate settings profiles depending on the power source AC/battery:
- Kernel laptop mode and dirty buffer params
- Processor frequency scaling including "turbo boost" / "turbo core"
- Limit max/min P-state to control power dissipation of the CPU - intel_pstate only
- Power aware process scheduler for multi-core/hyper-threading
- Processor performance versus energy savings policy (x86_energy_perf_policy)
- Hard disk advanced power magement level and spin down timeout (per disk)
- SATA aggressive link power management (ALPM)
- PCIe active state power management (PCIe ASPM) - Kernel 2.6.35 and above
- Runtime power management for PCI(e) bus devices - Kernel 2.6.35 and above
- Radeon graphics KMS power management - Kernel 2.6.35 and above, not fglrx
- Radeon graphics dynamic power management - Kernel 3.11 and above, not fglrx
- Wifi power saving mode -  depending on kernel/driver
- Enable/disable integrated radio devices (excluding connected devices)
- Power off optical drive in UltraBay/MediaBay (on battery)
- Audio power saving mode - hda_intel, ac97

Additional functions:
- I/O scheduler (per disk)
- X86 energy perf policy
- USB autosuspend with driver and device blacklist (input devices excluded automatically)
- Enable or disable integrated radio devices upon system startup and shutdown
- Restore radio device state on system startup (from previous shutdown)
- Radio device wizard: switch radios upon network connect/disconnect and dock/undock
- Disable Wake On LAN
- Integrated wwan state is restored after suspend/hibernate
- Untervolting of Intel processors - requires kernel with PHC-Patch
- Battery charge thresholds - ThinkPads only
- Recalibrate battery - ThinkPads only

All TLP settings are stored in /etc/default/tlp. The default configuration
provides optimized power saving out of the box.

Or take a look at the manpages:
- tlp
- tlp-stat (display tlp status and active settings)
- wifi, bluetooth, wwan (switch wireless devices on/off)
- run-on-ac, run-on-bat
