Description: Optimize laptop battery life
 TLP is a feature-rich command-line utility, saving laptop battery power
 without the need to delve deeper into technical details.
 .
 TLP’s default settings are already optimized for battery life and implement
 Powertop’s recommendations out of the box. Moreover TLP is highly
 customizable to fulfil specific user requirements.
 .
 Settings are organized into the three customizable profiles performance (AC),
 balanced (BAT) and power-saver (SAV), allowing to adjust between savings
 and performance independently for battery and AC operation.
 .
 In addition TLP can enable or disable bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and WWAN
 devices on boot.
 .
 For ThinkPads and many other laptop brands it provides a unified way to
 configure charge thresholds and recalibrate the battery.
