Description: Optimize laptop battery life
 TLP is a feature-rich command-line utility, saving laptop battery power
 without the need to delve deeper into technical details.
 .
 TLP’s default settings are already optimized for battery life and implement
 Powertop’s recommendations out of the box. Moreover TLP is highly
 customizable to fulfil specific user requirements.
 .
 Settings are organized into two profiles, allowing to adjust between
 savings and performance independently for battery (BAT) and AC operation.
 In addition TLP can enable or disable Bluetooth, NFC, Wi-Fi and WWAN radio
 devices on boot.
 .
 For ThinkPads and selected other laptops it provides a unified way
 to configure charge thresholds and recalibrate the battery.

 Together with TLP as the backend for applying the customizable profiles,
 it replaces power-profiles-daemon.
